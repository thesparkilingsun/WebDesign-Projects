Nobody Knows Exactly What Attracts Women
If you thought that you’ll get a simple answer, pardon me. There is no clear-cut definition of female attraction. That’s the truth.

If someone says that they know, they’re lying. There is no research data or study that claim anything solid.

Female attraction is different than male.

Male attraction is pretty straightforward. We are visual. Doesn’t matter from where she belongs/lives, we are attracted because of her attractive looks.

A woman needs to be mentally stimulated. Whether she’ll find you attractive or not, can depend on many unknown factors. Sometimes, they don’t even know what they want.

The Power of Vulnerability & Honesty
Usually, when approaching anybody, your primary objective is to be good to them. Make them feel good about you, so they like you more. Pretty basic.

How can you do it the best way?

See, people are most affected by the way you present yourself. Your intentions speak louder than anything.
