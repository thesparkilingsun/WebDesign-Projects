        <h3>Popular Typography in Webdesign</h3>

        <p>Sans serifs have made quite a statement in graphic design. Their slightly sophisticated modern mystique gives the designer room to create expression and emotion.
          We also see sans serifs as a new standard for “clean” work. </p>
        <img class="imgSizer shadow" src="images/sans.jpg" alt="Minimal Sans Serifs">
        <p>hand lettering become more transmissive, taking on an array of stylistic
          expressions with tones that feel less feminine or “schoolhouse” type, and are more bold,
          rustic, and edgy. There’s so much nuance in hand lettering; it
          gives the artist more uniqueness that can’t easily be replicated.</p>

        <h3>Popular Typograhy in Print Media</h3>

        <p>Read between the lines in 2019 by incorporating outlined
          text into your design strategy. Outlined text is a modern
          take on the classic serif by creating designs that feel light and
          airy without losing bold impact</p>
        <img class="imgSizer shadow" src="images/outline.jpg" alt="Overlay Menu">
        <img class="imgSizer shadow" src="images/serif.jpg" alt="Vertical  Trail Result">
        <p>Everything old is new again with the rise of glamorous serif fonts making their comeback in headers just like in the sixties and seventies. State your message with the understated elegance of a clean serif font for 2019. Sophisticated
          headings with serif type make minimalistic design pop without intricate design. Elegant serif fonts are ideal for communicating a luxurious, high-end feel, often catering to older audiences.

        <h4>Scattered Text</h4>
        <img class="imgSizer shadow" src="images/scatter.jpg" alt="Scattered text">
        <p>Scattered text adds movement to otherwise
          simple designs by thoughtfully breaking up text
          in a readable way. Playing on the trend of placing
          type both horizontally and vertically, scattered text
          is a unique way to tell a story with type by leveraging
          white space in unique ways. Catering to a milennial audience?
          This type trend is sure to
          capture their attention and leave them wanting to know more.</p>
        <h4>Big, Bold Headings</h4>
        <img class="imgSizer shadow " src="images/bold.jpg" alt="Big Bold">
        <p>Go big or go home--in 2019, bigger and bolder is better with
          headers that communicate messages dramatically. With headers like
          these, it’s often best to let the type speak for itself by
          leaving backgrounds clean and distraction free. To leverage
          this trend, opt for sharp, modern sans serif type
          and add personality with pops of colour in your content.</p>

          <h4>Typography effects moods</h4>
          <p>Kevin Larson and Rosalind Picard presented their findings on how typography effects moods in their paper, The Aesthetics of Reading,
            which also dealt with the benefits of good typography.
            Following is a very simple example, the first in the study. Which one do you think looks better and more enjoyable to read?
            The only thing that is different in both the documents is the layout and placement of the text. The second image is very clearly easier to read and most would even be excited to read it. It is crisp and clear, and the layout is preferred
            greatly over the other.

            The first image seems quite confusing and almost as if it is too much to process. It can confuse your mind and simply is not even pleasing to look at.

            These processes happen all the time in our brains and greatly reflect on our mood and choices we make after.

            Similarly, the paper also tests the manner in which a text is written, including ligatures, small caps, numerals, sub/superscript features and so on.

            Even the spaces between each letter, word, sentence and paragraph effects your mood and productivity on certain cognitive tasks.
          </p>
          <h4>Positive Mood, Better Results</h4>
          <p>It is only obvious that the more positivity your illustration induces, the more they will be attracted to your brand and business. The study above proves that good typography boosts cognitive performance too.

            The truth is typography can also impact judgement. The New York Times conducted a study, “Are you an optimist or pessimist?” Although the study discussed feelings of participants of security during catastrophic events, it was more about
            the
            effects typeface can have on you. And since no harm was caused, perhaps it could be called ethical too.</p>
